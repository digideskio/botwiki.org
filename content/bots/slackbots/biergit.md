[Biergit](http://biergit.net/) is a Slack bot created by [Koch Essen Kommunikation + Design GmbH](https://twitter.com/koch_essen). 

> Biergit is a Beerbot, built by the nerd division of [koch-essen.de](http://koch-essen.de/) - a German based Advertising Agency. Biergit is used within the office to know how much beer is left in the fridge and who's next in line with buying.
